# Credit_Default_Risk_Prediction
This project focuses on predicting credit card default risk using advanced machine learning techniques. The dataset originally had over 122 features and 300,000+ entries, which were reduced to 20 carefully selected features through feature engineering and dimensionality reduction. To address data imbalance, resampling techniques were used.
